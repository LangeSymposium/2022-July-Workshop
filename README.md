### Module 3: Career Panel with Data Scientists, 5:30pm-6:30pm

Moderator: Dr. Eric Sobel. 

Panelists:   

  - Emma Zohner, PhD - Principal Data Scientist, Engine No. 1.  

  - Kevin Keys, PhD - Scientist II, Ambys Medicines.   
  
  - Christina Ramirez, PhD - Professor, UCLA.   

  - Roch Nianogo, PhD - Professor, UCLA.   

## Wifi

Use `Eduroam` or `UCLA_WEB`. 

- `UCLA_WEB` does not need password.  
- `Eduroam` needs authentication by your institute. For example, UCLA affiliates can log in `Eduroam` by `[joebruin]@ucla.edu`  and the UCLA password. 

## Run Jupyter notebooks on your own laptop

This is **not** recommended during this workshop, since your software environment (OS, software versions, package versions, etc.) may be quite different from that assumed by the Jupyter notebooks. In case you want to run Jupyter notebooks on your own machine, simply `git clone ???` to sync the most recent course materials to your computer and install all needed software.
