### Module 3: Career Panel with Data Scientists, 5:30pm-6:30pm

Moderator: Dr. Eric Sobel. 

Panelists:   

  - [Kevin Keys](https://www.lathisms.org/calendar-2021s/kevin-l-keys), PhD - Scientist II, Ambys Medicines.
  
  - [Roch Nianogo](https://ph.ucla.edu/faculty/nianogo), PhD - Professor, UCLA.

  - [Christina Ramirez](https://ph.ucla.edu/faculty/ramirez), PhD - Professor, UCLA.

  - [Emma Zohner](https://engine1.com/team/emma-zohner), PhD - Principal Data Scientist, Engine No. 1.

## Wifi

If you are not a UCLA affiliate, use **eduroam** or **UCLA_WEB** as your WIFI network.

- **UCLA_WEB** does not need a password. (Do not confuse with UCLA_WIFI, which will require a username and password.)
- **Eduroam** needs authentication by your institute. If you have not used eduroam before, visit the [eduroam](https://eduroam.org/about/connect-yourself/) site for instructions.

## How to run the optional tutorials using Jupyter Notebooks

During the workshop you may run the optional tutorials on our server. We do **not** recommend running the tutorials on your own laptop during the workshop, because your software environment (OS, software versions, package versions, etc.) may be quite different from ours. If you want to run Jupyter Notebooks on your own machine after the workshop, simply *git clone* [https://github.com/LangeSymposium/2022-July-Workshop.git](https://github.com/LangeSymposium/2022-July-Workshop.git) to sync the most recent course materials to your computer and install all needed software. At the workshop you will receive the connection details.

## Workshop server

We provide a server where you can run tutorials (Jupyter notebooks) during the workshop.

1. Server address: <http://34.106.153.89/> 

2. **Username** will be same as the email address (before the @, all lower case) you used to register for the workshop. For example, if you registered for the workshop using email `Jane.Bruin@ucla.edu`, then your username on the server will be `jane.bruin`. **Password** is announced during the workshop.

### Tips

1. Anytime during the workshop, feel free to ask for help. 

    Course assistants: 
    - Dr. Ben Chu  
    - Dr. Sarah Ji  
    - Dr. Seyoon Ko  
    - Dr. Alfonso Landeros  
    - Dr. Xiaoqian Liu  
    - Do Hyun Kim   
    - Dr. Jeanette Papp  
    - Dr. Eric Sobel  
    - Dr. Hua Zhou  
    - Dr. Jin Zhou  
    - Xinkai Zhou  
    
2. In JupyterLab, avoid running many kernels at the same time. Promptly shut down the kernels you don't use. 

3. If your kernel dies, most likely you have used more resource (CPU - 1 core and memory - 3.6 GB) than allocated. Make sure that you shut down the kernels not in use and try again. Remember that running the tutorials is optional. You can always read the static slides if the server is not responding.
